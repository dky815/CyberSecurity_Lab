# CVE Research

The objective of this task is to get you familiar with the various aspects of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). “CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this ‘common enumeration.” When you explore vulnerabilities that can happen in real products you learn about how difficult they can be to find and prevent.

* You work in a group of three students.
* Students in a group *preferably *select related CVEs.
* Two students in the class cannot select the same CVEs.
* Each group will be mentored by one of the TAs.

In this task, each group selects three CVEs and each of the group members researches one of them. You should be careful not to select a dead-end CVE without no publicly available information, and your selected CVEs cannot be the ones you try in the course assignments. If your selected CVEs are related to some services/devices/products/technologies involved in your security analysis that may help to accomplish more interesting results.

It is preferred that your selected CVEs be related in some way: being in the same vulnerability category, affecting the same product/ service, rooted in the same programming flaw, disclosed/exploited, and so on. Each student researched about one CVE but at the same time collaborates with his/her group members to connect their individual studies by answering similar/related questions about three selected CVEs and concluding their research as a group. In your research about a CVE you can cover some of the following topics:

* Vulnerability description and impact
* Vulnerability lifecycle and trend
* Demonstration of how the vulnerability can be exploited. You can use proof of concept code or Metasploit to exploit the vulnerability. You may include screenshots or other evidence of success.
* Describing the traces in the system logs left by the attack
* Describing how the attack done by exploiting the vulnerability might be detected by an intrusion detection system
* Describing the programming flaw that causes the vulnerability

You are expected to write a report of up to seven pages and present your findings to the class. In your report, you may assign six pages to three studied CVEs and then use the last page to connect the studied CVEs and make conclusions. Your report will be assessed based on, but not limited to, your research thoroughness, technical depth and conclusive remarks.

In selecting CVE you may consider the ones available in Metasploit. This will ease your task if you want to study vulnerability exploitation as you can find the exploit directly there. This will be even easier if you work on CVEs included in intentionally vulnerable systems such as [Metasploitable3 **Links to an external site.**](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/11/15/test-your-might-with-the-shiny-new-metasploitable3/) and [Metasploitable2 **Links to an external site.**](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2-exploitability-guide/) since you will access the vulnerable system.

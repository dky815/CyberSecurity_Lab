# Security Analysis Project

For the security analysis project, you need to evaluate the security of a software system such as a website, mobile application, cloud application, client program, and so on. Your report should include platform analysis, software security model, attack model, threats, vulnerabilities, result analysis, and best practices and recommendations for resolving security flaws and improving the protection of the system. For security analysis projects you need to obtain written permission from the company or owner of the software before you start any further analysis. The deadline for getting the required permission is October 1st. [Here](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/71722/pages/email-template "Email Template") you can find a template email to contact the product owner. [Here](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/71722/pages/companies-and-products-for-security-analysis "Companies and Products for Security Analysis") is the list of companies/products that I have already obtained their owner permission for the security analysis project and you can choose one of those if you want.

Your final security testing report must be 20-25 pages. Here is the format of a formal **Penetration** **testing** **report**:

* Executive Summary ( Scope of work, Project Objectives, Assumptions, Timeline, Summary of Findings, Summary of Recommendation )
* Methodology
* Detail findings ( Vulnerabilities, Impact,  Likelihood of Vulnerabilities, Risk evaluation, Recommendations)

Your project output will be evaluated based on the depth and breadth of your analysis, quality of your report's presentation, and the recommendations that you provided to improve the software security vulnerabilities. The project is worth 15% of your final grade but outstanding results will have up to 5% extra credit.

* You work in a group of six students.
* Contribution of each student to the project will be considered and evaluated carefully.
* You must let the instructor know about your project topic as soon as possible.
* Each group should let the others know about their project topic here:

* Two groups cannot have the same project topic.
* Each group will be mentored by one of the TAs.

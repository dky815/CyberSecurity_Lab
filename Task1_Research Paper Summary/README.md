# Research Paper Summary

In the research paper review task you read, comprehend and summarize a research paper.

* You work in a group of *three *students.
* You must announce your group members on Canvas: [$CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/users](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/71722/users) under one of the *paper *groups.
* Students in a group *must *select papers about the same topic.
* Two students *cannot *review the same paper.

For the paper review task you need to select a paper published in the last four years in one of the journals or conferences listed below based on your research interest:

* [ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security **Links to an external site.**](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tops)
* [ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference (CCS)**Links to an external site.**](https://dl.acm.org/conference/ccs)
* [USENIX Security Symposium**Links to an external site.**](https://www.usenix.org/publications/proceedings)
* [IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security**Links to an external site.**](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-transactions-information-forensics-and-security)
* [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy**Links to an external site.**](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/)
* [Computers & Security**Links to an external site.**](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-security)

You are expected to read the paper in depth and understand the addressed domain and its technical aspects. To fulfill this task, each group needs to write an up to eight-page report and present the studied papers orally in the class. On the first six pages of the report, each student presents the paper summary in two pages, and on the last two pages of the report, the group writes a conclusion about the studied domain.

Your paper summary and presentation should cover the addressed research problem and related work, proposed solution and experimental evaluation, and conclusion and future work. Discussing paper weaknesses and methodological suggestions to improve the paper is a plus. Your work will be assessed considering the clarity and completeness of your summary and presentation.

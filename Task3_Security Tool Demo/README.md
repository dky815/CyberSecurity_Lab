# Security Tool Demo

You will select a security tool to explore and demonstrate its functionality as well as
provide context for its use cases. For this task, you not only learn how to apply the selected tool for security purposes but also show its key capabilities of it using three different use cases.

* You work in a group of three students.
* Two groups cannot select the same security tool.
* Each group will be mentored by one of the TAs.

You are expected to write a four-page report and present your findings to the class. The first page of the report will introduce the tool and the next three pages will describe the use cases and your experimental results.  Being creative and innovative in showing the selected tool's capability will be considered in your evaluation.  Report clarity and completeness of presentation are desired.
